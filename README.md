This is ~~supposed to be~~ a very annoying ~~infinite~~ recurring alarm that plays if I snooze my final alarm for the morning
and some conditions aren't met. 
It uses the Spotify API via [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io)[^1].

Spotipy can be installed with the command: `pip install spotipy --upgrade`
It can also be obtained from [its repo](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) here on github.

- The main code is stored in *filtered_main.py*.

Some background info:
---
- I linked my phone alarm to my Spotify
- I wake up to certain songs daily
- My warning alarm is at 6:30 am, my final is by 7:00 am.
- Everyday, when I wake up, I send my alarm song to play on my laptop - which is always open and plugged in on my desk in the morning from previous night - at full blast. __This only happens when I've fully woken up.__
- I'm only human, so I sometimes snooze _all_ my alarms including the final one.


Target Functionality
---
 Since I blast music on my laptop in the morning, the code should:
 
- [x] Check if I've ~~played a song at full blast~~ opened Spotify on my latop and am playing music by 7:05 am.
       
If I haven't:
1. [ ] Turn my laptop volume all the way up[^2]
2. [x] Switch my Spotify playback device (my phone from the alarms) to my laptop[^3]
3. [x] Play some music[^4].
       
If I'm still really groggy and pause the music from my phone:

- [x] resume playback with a 2 minute grace period until I close the app, ~~or - for something more interesting - complete a challenge.~~

Updates
 ---
  - Just added auto execution functionality with Windows via a batch file, *filtered_auto.bat*, that I scheduled to run every morning at 6:55 am using the Windows task scheduler exe.

What's Next
---
I need to figure out:
- how to adjust the system volume automatically
- how the whole OAuth2 credential thingy works and perhaps automate the whole fetching process so other people can use my code since I'm pretty much done :-).

[^1]: I'll eventually learn how to use the requests module, and maybe update this to be wholly my own.
[^2]: It seems I will need to either find a way to do this via a batchfile, i.e (finally get round to properly learning Powershell), or with Python or C++ using the windows API. In any case, some studying is requisite, so I'd better get cracking :-)
[^3]: I might make it playback from my phone depending on the effectiveness. So I'll get an annoying infinite alarm until I terminate the code.
[^4]: ~~I'm considering using Of Monsters and Men's _'Visitor'_, but I might just make it pick a random song from my playlist.~~ Random music is fine to break monotony.
